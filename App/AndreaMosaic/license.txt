Copyright 1997-2011 Andrea Denzler. All Rights Reserved. License date 30 March 2011, version 1.1.

1. EVERY MOSAIC (OR DERIVATIVE WORK) IS CREATED AND PUBLISHED (OR DISTRIBUTED IN ANY WAY) MUST INCLUDE A CLEAR, EVIDENT AND WELL VISIBLE WRITTEN CREDIT TO ANDREAMOSAIC. THE CREDIT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED OVER THE MOSAIC BUT TOGETHER WITH IT. On a web page add a link to AndreaMosaic home page. When printed add a note about AndreaMosaic together with the print. In other words who will see the mosaic must know and see that you used AndreaMosaic. 
Like when you publish a photograph and you give the credit to the Photographer. Like if you publish a painting and you give the credit to yourself as the author but also to the whoever gave you a free paintbrush & colours (AndreaMosaic).

2. IF YOU CREATE A SPECIAL MOSAIC OR ONE THAT WILL BE SHOWN ON A LARGE PUBLIC AUDIENCE THEN YOU MUST INFORM ANDREA DENZLER ("the AUTHOR") ABOUT IT, SO THAT A SMALL THUMBNAIL IMAGE OF YOUR WORK CAN BE ADDED TO THE "LIST OF THE ARTWORKS" CREATED WITH ANDREAMOSAIC. The "list of the artworks" is a selection of nice mosaics published on the AndreaMosaic web page. I really would like to know about any work that was created with AndreaMosaic. 

3. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM WITH A DONATION. If you use AndreaMosaic commercially (i.e. you get any profit with it), then you really should support it, proportionally to the value the program is giving you.
